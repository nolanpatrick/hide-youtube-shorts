# Hide Youtube Shorts

A simple Greasemonkey script that hides YouTube Shorts from appearing in the homepage and subscription feed. Also hides the 'Shorts' button on the sidebar.

## Getting started

First, install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension. If you are using Chrome, the Tampermonkey extension may work, but I have not tested it.

Next, create a new script.

Finally, paste the contents of HideShorts.user.js into the new script.

Depending on the extension you are using, you may or may not need to enable the script. Scripts are automatically enabled in Greasemonkey.
